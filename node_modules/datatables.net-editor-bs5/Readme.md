## Editor NPM Bootstrap 4 styling package

[Editor](https://editor.datatables.net) is an extension for the [DataTables Javascript library](https://datatables.net) which adds full editing abilities to a DataTable, including row creation and deletion, multi-row editing, inline and bubble editing and full integration with Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI and others. Full details and live examples for Editor can be found on [its web-site](https://editor.datatables.net).



## Installing Editor

Editor is commercial software and thus is not suitable for distribution via NPM directly. As such the primary method to include Editor on your page is to [download the Editor packages](https://editor.datatables.net/download) or use the [DataTables download builder](https://datatables.net/download). However, NPM packages are useful for package builders such as WebPack and Yarn, which is why this package is available.


### Bash installation

The `datatables.net-editor` NPM package includes an install script which can be run to install the licensed files from the downloaded Editor zip file, for this package and the other styling. Please refer to the Readme.md file in `datatables.net-editor` package.
