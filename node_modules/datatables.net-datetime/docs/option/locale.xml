			Set the locale that the external date parsing library ([Moment](https://momentjs.com/), [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) or [DayJS](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs)) will use for parsing and formatting strings.

		The locale that DateTime uses by default is English.

	<description>
		This allows the _locale_ that DateTime uses to be set - it is only used when using an external parsing and formatting library such as [Moment](https://momentjs.com/), [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) or [DayJS](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs). You must also load the locale you need for your formatting library of choice.

		This option is related to the `de-init i18n` option in the DateTime library in that it is used for internationalisation, but in this case it is used for the input value - letting the library parse and format strings in languages other than English (e.g. names of days or months).
