		This option is used if either `de-init maxDate` or `de-init minDate` are not in use to determine how many years to show to the user for selection.

		To determine the max year that can be selected this value is added to the current year. Similarly for min year this value is subtracted. If `de-init maxDate` or `de-init minDate` are declared then it will not be used to determine the range in the relative directions.
